        <ul class="funFactsList">
            <li>Did you know that Venus is hotter than Mercury?</li>
            <li>Jupiter has the biggest ocean of any planet, but it's made of liquid hydrogen!</li>
            <li>Neptune has supersonic winds, which are the fastest in the solar system!</li>
            <li>The Sun may look like a big, bright circle in the sky, but it's actually a giant star. It's the closest star to Earth and provides us with light and warmth!</li>
            <li>The Moon doesn't always look the same. It goes through different shapes, called phases, like a crescent, half-moon, and full moon. This happens because of how the Sun's light shines on it!</li>
            <li>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it spins really fast. A day on Mercury is only about 59 Earth days long, but a year (the time it takes to go around the Sun) is about 88 Earth days!</li>
            <li>Mars, often called the "Red Planet," sometimes has huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet. These storms can last for months and make it hard to see the surface!</li>
            <li>Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings made of ice and rocks. These rings can be seen from Earth with a telescope, and they make Saturn look like a giant cosmic hula hoop!</li>
            <li>When astronauts go to space, they can float around inside their spacecraft. This happens because there's very little gravity in space, so everything becomes weightless!</li>
