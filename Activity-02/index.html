            History of Photography<br>
        </b></h1>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">"Photography, as we know it today, began in the early 1800s in France when inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce created a prototype of a photographic camera in 1816. 
            He used a portable camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This is the first recorded image that did not fade quickly. 
            He is credited for taking the oldest surviving photograph, dated from 1826, of a view from the window of his house."

            7 Basic Compositions in Photography

        <H4 style="color: white;">
            1. RULE OF THIRDS
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                <!--<img src="/Activity-02/thirds.jpg" alt="Lady in Garden"; style="width: 300px; float:inline-end; margin: 10px;"> FOR INSERTING IMAGE-->
                You must place your subject in a third of the overall area. It means on the right or on the left but not in the middle. <br>
                Use the grid in your camera to be precise. Put the intersection of the upper vertical line and the middle horizontal 
                line on the face of your subject if you are taking the photo of total body and background or on the eyes if you are taking a close up.
                
            </p>
        <H4 style="color: white;">
            2. LEADING LINES
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                The photography rule of lines is very important. Lines tend to guide viewer’s eyes. For this reason, you have to follow 
                the lines to take straight pictures but for other benefits too. Some lines bring viewers to focus their attention to the 
                subject like railways, roads, or natural lines in a landscape make your photos immediately more interesting and original.
            </p>
        <H4 style="color: white;">
            3. DEPTH
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                Depth is the distance between your subject and the background and gives two- or three-dimensional perspective to your pictures. 
                More distance you have, more depth of field there will be. How to give depth to your picture? Take your subject distant from the
                 background and follow the rules of thirds at the same time to have a perfect perspective that gives a sense of depth   
            </p>
        <H4 style="color: white;">
            4. SYMMETRY
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                Sometimes you are in front of a building or natural lines that are exactly in symmetry. It means that the right part is 
                perfectly identical to the left part and each element repeats itself. A perfect structure where you can put your subject in the middle.       
            </p>
        <H4 style="color: white;">
            5. CINEMATIC
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                If you want to take beautiful photos, from now on be mindful when you watch a movie. You will notice the presence of 
                particular shots that the director repeats constantly during the movie.<br> 
                <br>
                For example you will see close up with the rule of thirds where a little piece of head is cut (to put the focus on the 
                facial expression and give breadth to the rest of the scene) or the person who appears from the back is in three quarters
                 (useful if you want take reportage pictures) or also other particular ways to take pictures of details and people.       
            </p>
        <H4 style="color: white;">
            6. DONT DECAPITATE SUBJECT
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                When you want to take a beautiful close up don’t commit the error to go too close and cut exactly under the chin line. 
                The effect will be terrible. So, remind to frame under the collar bones. This will give breadth to your portrait.       
            </p>
        <H4 style="color: white;">
            7. DON'T SHOT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
        </H4>
            <p style="font-size:medium; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: white;">
                When you want to take a group picture or just a portrait remember not to shoot from the top. If you do that, your subjects 
                will appear with large heads and short legs, definitely not the most flattering proportions.
