            <h1>FILIPINO FOOD DELICACIES</h1>
                <p>
                    The Philippines is a tropical archipelago with a vast range of ethnic groups, stunning scenery, colourful cultures and amazing food. Diversity 
                    of cuisine is not unusual in South East Asian countries, but Filipino food is somewhat unique. Its complex and varied history really gives it an East meets West 
                    dimension. In particular, the Spanish influence is strong, as it was a Spanish colony for over 300 years from 1565.  Here are some of its top dishes, including a few national dishes of the Philippines.

                    A classic dish influenced by the Spanish! Adobo refers to a common cooking process indigenous to the Philippines. Its main ingredients are those native to Southeast Asia - vinegar, soy sauce or 
                    patis (fish sauce), black peppercorns and cinnamomum tamala leaves. The dish is normally cooked with pork or chicken, and sometimes with only vegetables like kangkong (water spinach) or sitaw (green beans).

                        <figcaption>Arguably one of the most contreversial food in the Philippines, balut has been a tradition and a continuing delicacy in the country.</figcaption>

                    Balut is the Philippine word for fertilized duck eggs in which the embryos are allowed to develop for a time before the eggs are hard cooked. They are considered a great delicacy and are thought to have a 
                    therapeutic value as a food for invalids

                    The name means “mix-mix" in Tagalog—the refreshing dish layers shaved ice and condensed milk on top of all sorts of ingredients for an end result that packs in lots of contrasting textures, from chewy to 
                    crunchy, creamy to sticky. While components vary, you'll find some common add-ins at most halo-halo carts and bars: jellies, flan, macapuno, palm seeds, sweetened red beans, shaved ice, ube ice cream, fresh fruit, 
                    toasted coconut flakes, pinipig.
