            <h1>BORACAY</h1>
                <p>
                    While only 7km tall and at its bikini line 500m wide, tiny Boracay is the Philippines' 
                    top tourist draw, fuelled by explosive growth and a tsunami of hype. The influx of visitors 
                    caused the Philippines government to temporarily close Boracay to tourists for six months. 
                    This 'rehabilitation' period, was used to restore the island to its former glory and it has since 
                    reopened with a limit on the number of daily visitors.

                <p>
                    The centre of the action is dreamy White Beach, a 4km, postcard-perfect stretch of sand lined from 
                    one end to the other with hotels, restaurants, bars and dive shops several blocks deep. The beach path 
                    is typically awash with visitors, including large groups of package tourists.

                <p>
                    The ocean is full of romantic paraws (an outrigger sailboat) giving rides; colourful parasails fill the air. 
                    SAfter perfect sunsets, live music breaks out, and fire dancers twirl their batons.
